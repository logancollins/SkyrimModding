A list of cool Skyrim mods I recommend checking out.

Note: all of these are from the perspective of **Skyrim Special Edition**, the remastered version released in 2016. In 2021 this was updated to the "Anniversary Edition", so if you see "SE" and "AE" thrown around, they are almost always interchangeable.

As far as I know, everything on this list is compatibile with each other, as everything here I have running now. There may be conflicts in some places (especially in Environmental mods), but they can usually be sorted easily using Vortex to choose the proper load order.

### Basics

**Vortex**: the modern mod manager (https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/)
**Unofficial Skyrim Patch**: fixes a ton of random bugs and issues (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)
**Skyrim Script Extender**: I _believe_ Vortex installs this automatically nowadays on first deploy (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379)

**JK's Environmental Mods** (there are many, just search for "JK's", but these are particularly good):
