# Recommendations

A list of cool Skyrim mods I recommend checking out.

Note: all of these are from the perspective of **Skyrim Special Edition**, the remastered version released in 2016. In 2021 this was updated to the "Anniversary Edition", so if you see "SE" and "AE" thrown around, they are almost always interchangeable.

As far as I know, everything on this list is compatibile with each other, as everything here I have running now. There may be conflicts in some places (especially in Environmental mods), but they can usually be sorted easily using Vortex to choose the proper load order.

## Basics

- **[Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/)**: the modern mod manager
- **[Unofficial Skyrim Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)**: fixes a ton of random bugs and issues
- **[Skyrim Script Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379)**: I _believe_ Vortex installs this automatically nowadays on first deploy

## UI / Quality of Life

- **[SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604)**: sounds like you've used this before
- **[TrueHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62775)**: brings a high-res modern battle HUD including over-enemy health gauges
- **[Detection Meter NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77350)**: brings AC-style sneak indicators; "NG" is the version for Skyrim "AE", e.g. 1.6+.
- **Third-person improvements**:
    - **[Better Third Person Selection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64339)**: DA:I / Witcher3-style third-person item selection
    - **[SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252)**: reworks third-person view to behave more like a console RPG, with assistive-aim for bows and smoother movements. Can be highly customized.
    - **[True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614)**: overhauls third-person character movement to be more like modern console RPGs.
    - **[Precision - Accurate Melee Collisions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347)**: adds more accurate melee impacts during third-person combat
- **[Auto Input Switch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54309)**: adds autoswap between mouse/keyboard and controller like most modern games.
- **[RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080)**: a massively overhauled character creator giving full control over everything

## Environmental

- **[Daedric Shrines collection](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/tdqfkc)**: adds high-res models for the 12 daedric shrines
- **JK's Environmental Mods**: (there are many, just search for "JK's", but these are particularly good):
    - **[JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289)**: improvements to every major city. Not particularly GPU-taxing.
    - **[JK's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65676)**: same as above, but for the College.
- **[Blended Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8834)**: improves texture alignment of roads to make them seem more natural
- **[Simply Bigger Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5281)**: makes all trees like 4x larger without breaking things, for a far more immersive experience. Didn't impact performance.
- **[Folkvangr - Grass and Landscape Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44899)**: adds improved textures for grass and landscapes
- **[Splashes of Storms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72115)**: adds true rainstorms of varying intensity; highly recommend.

- **[Enhanced Lights and FX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424)**: adds considerably better light rendering and casting

- **[8K Night Skies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20301)**: adds vastly improved starscapes and moon textures (can be customized from 2K to 8K; go for the lower-end, you won't notice)
- **[Volumetric Mists](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29273)**: adds more realistic fog and mists to regions. May be GPU-taxing.
- **[FSMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339)**: improves render speed of cloth-like meshes (capes, clothes, hair, etc.)

## Character

- **[Alternate Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272)**: lets you start the game in 8 or so different places, without going through the intro in Helgen
- **[KS Hairdos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817)**: adds many new high-quality hairstyle options
Hvergelmir's Aesthetic Series:
    - **[Brows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1062)**: adds greatly improved eyebrow textures

- **[Fine Face Textures for Men](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4759)**: adds some younger-looking facial complexions for male characters, since Skyrim PCs tend to look age 60+.

## NPCs

- **[Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461)**: arguably the best follower for the game; fully voiced, lore-friendly, has his own questline.
- **[Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035)**: my second favorite follower mod; Similar to Inigo, has his own questline as well. I recommend having them both together.
- **[Interesting NPCs (3DNPC)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194)**: adds over 250 new voiced NPCs throughout Skyrim with questlines, followers, and more.
- **Pandorable's NPCs**, adds high-quality appearance reworks of the major NPCs in the game's various factions:
    - [The Women](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19012)
    - [The Men, pt 1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42043)

- **[Snow Elves of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81981)**: adds improved appearance for two specific Dawnguard NPCs, better than Pandorables IMO (install alongside, load this after Pandorable's Dawnguard)
- **[NPC Animation Remix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63471)**: adds casual idle animations during conversations
- **[Gesture Animation Remix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64420)**: adds casual idle animations during their pathed AI movements

## Questlines

- **[The Paarthurnax Dilemma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/365)**: fixes the fact that Delphine gives you no option not to kill Paarthurnax.

## Weapons, Armors, etc.

- **[Immersive Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3479)**: adds a ton of new lore-friendly armors to the game to improve asset reuse and atmosphere
    - **[Immersive Armors Retexture Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75891)**: a patch to Immersive Armors, as the former hasn't been updated since 2016.
